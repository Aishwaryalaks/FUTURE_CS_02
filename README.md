 🛡️ Security Alert Monitoring & Incident Response – Internship Task

📘 Project Overview

This project was completed as part of my cybersecurity internship under the **Cyber Security Track (CS)**. The goal was to monitor simulated security alerts, identify suspicious activities, classify incidents, and draft a structured SOC-style incident response report.

 🛠️ Tools Used

- **Elastic Stack (ELK)**: Elasticsearch, Logstash/Filebeat, Kibana for log ingestion, filtering, and dashboard visualization  
- **Splunk Free Trial**: SIEM exploration for alert correlation and log triage  
- **Sample HTTP Log Files**: Used for simulating access patterns and probe attempts

 📁 Repository Contents

- `incident-report.docx` – Final report detailing triage, visualization, and mitigation  
- `tools-used.txt` – Version details and tool context  
- `queries/` – KQL filters for identifying suspicious access attempts  
- `screenshots/` – Visual evidence and dashboard captures  
- `test-notes.txt` – Summary of SOC workflow and key observations  
- `README.md` – Project summary and repo guide

---

 🔍 Skills Gained

- Log filtering and KQL query design  
- Alert triage and endpoint behavior analysis  
- Incident classification and SOC documentation  
- Dashboard creation using Kibana panels

---

 ✅ Highlights

- Detected repeated access attempts to `/admin` endpoint triggering `403 Forbidden`  
- Visualized probing behavior and payload consistency across time and IP addresses  
- Drafted mitigation strategies including access controls, rate limiting, and alert rules
